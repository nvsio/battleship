#### People.Co Battleship Challenge

##### About Tech Draft
People.Co is a venture-backed startup focused on building a next-generation recruiting platform for talent sourcing, analytics, and assessment. They have designed Tech Draft to be similar to the NFL Draft, but instead with top tech companies looking to recruit top college software engineers. Applicants are accepted based on a scoring metric that reflects rigor of study, GPA, university, portfolio/projects, internship & work experience, and extracurricular activities. Accepted participants complete a series of technical challenges designed by sponsoring companies to test your software engineering skills and are awarded post graduate offers.

##### Battleship Challenge
Battleship is a classic two­-player guessing game which many of you may have played in actual board game or electronic form. Develop a program that acts like an intelligent battleship player and minimizes the number of “shots” required to find and sink all of the opposing player’s ships. [More information](/challenge.md).
